Hi, I’m Jackson Philion, a Harvey Mudd student from Boston and San Diego who's set to graduate in May 2025.
I’m interested in Digital Design, FPGA and MCU programming, Embedded Systems, and Hardware Engineering.
I love working on teams and projects that let me work on multiple sides of these topics, exploring the necessary
hardware and software programming to turn a vision into reality. I am actively exploring roles as a full-time
Electrical Engineer, hoping to find a place where I can pursue my interests alongside a similarly passionate team.

Additionally, I am passionate about Theatre, Snowboarding, Variant Sudoku, Reading, and more.

Anyone interested can reach me at jphilion@hmc.edu. I look forward to connecting!
